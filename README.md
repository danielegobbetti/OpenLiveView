OpenLiveView
============

*An open implementation of Sony's LiveView protocol.*

This Android application aims to be a complete replacement for the proprietary applications provided by Sony.
It does not yet support all the features of the official LiveView app, but it has a handy notification function that shows all android notifications on the LiveView.

Notice
------
The base of this implementation (figuring out the details of the protocol) was done by [Andrew de Quincey][adq], who posted details of the LiveView protocol on his blog and provided a Python server for use on a computer.
The basic implementation of the protocol as an Android app was done by [Robert Jacob][rj]. This repository has been forked from his project.

The code that can be found here is a copy of the code at the Google code project.

This project is no longer maintained by me (Renze). My second LiveView watch is broken and I am not using the software anymore. If you are looking for an open smartwatch you might want to take a look at the Sony Smartwatch 1. The Sony smartwatch 1 is completely open source and you can even develop your own firmware for it in the Arduino IDE.
